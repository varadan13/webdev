Stop wasting your time with technical SEO ❌

It’s not worth it.

Every SEO audit tool is feeding you DOZENS of “errors” and “flags” and “warnings” and wrapping it all up in a made-up "health score".

🚨 122 pages have nofollow and dofollow incoming internal links
🚨 61 pages with nofollow in HTML and HTTP header
🚨 48 pages with HTTPS and HTTP mixed content
🚨 312 pages with meta descriptions too short
🚨 431 pages with descriptions too long

Here's the reality:

Technical SEO is an _80/20_ game.

→ 80% of the results
→ 20% of the effort

(In fact, it’s probably closer to 95/5)

But I'm not blaming the tools—they're just delivering all the info.

It's on the SEO.

It's on them to filter through to find the 5% that creates the 95%.

So if your SEO agency is just sending you a 115 point to-do list they exporting from Ahrefs or Sitebulb with zero impact vs effort measures, then expecting you to ask for dev resources to action everything…

Pull the plug 🔌

Technical SEO absolutely _IS_ important.

But that doesn't mean you to need to action quite literally every single suggestion or adhere to every single best practice the tools are flagging to you.

Keep it simple.

→ Fast page load speeds
→ Clean link structure
→ Indexed pages

It'll take 10x less effort than trying to get an A+ on your audit score, and you'll be free to focus on what actually matters — qualified visits and conversions.
